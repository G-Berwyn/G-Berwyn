# Projects

In this repo you'll find a series of Data Science related projects I have conducted using Python and R, I also have expertise in Power BI, SQL, TypeScript and PySpark.

- Sheffield CAZ. This notebook is dedicated to a light-weight version of my dissertation where I developed a statistical model to assess the significance of Sheffield's Clean Air Zone
- Predicting COVID-19 Mortality. This notebook was inspired by an assignment. It looks at developing predicitive models to estimate COVID-19 fatalities in low-income countries where mortality statistics may be unreliable.
