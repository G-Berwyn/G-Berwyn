# Welcome to my GitHub

Hi, I'm Guto Williams, a 24 year old recent gradauate in Data Science with an interest in using data to explain and solve the world's problems.

I am particularly interested in using data to improve the world around us, from environment to equality to health.

# Projects

In this repo you'll find a series of Data Science related projects I have conducted using Python and R, I also have expertise in Power BI, SQL, TypeScript and PySpark.

- Sheffield CAZ. This notebook is dedicated to a light-weight version of my dissertation where I developed a statistical model to assess the significance of Sheffield's Clean Air Zone
- Predicting COVID-19 Mortality. This notebook was inspired by an assignment. It looks at developing predicitive models to estimate COVID-19 fatalities in low-income countries where mortality statistics may be unreliable.

My interests and education have inspired more projects that may not be hosted on GitHub, if you'd like to know more feel free to contact me!

# Education

**University of Sheffield - MSc Data Science**

I have recently completed an MSc in Data Science.

**University of Bath - MEng Mechanical Engineering**

My dissertation focused on imporoving the data processes for the University of Bath's carbon emissions. The processes were manual and data was siloed. My dissertation proposed data warehousing methods to impriove the flow of data and developing Power BI dashboards to increase the avaialbility of sustainability data.

Following this, I led a project with the university's Climate Action Team to implement improvements to their Scope 3 Procurement process. I developed new data processes to automate the process of estimating procurement emissions from expenditure data, working with large, complex datasets. I used Power Platform, Excel and VBA to automate these processes.

My work improved the data granularity and accuracy allowing for additional insight into the university's carbon footprint. To communicate these insights, I developed a series of dashboards and reports using Power BI utilising PowerQuery and DAX to build metrics and visualisations that provided insights and improved data communication.
